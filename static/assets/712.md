Here's my list of books on perfume making, as per request . Let me preface the post with the warning that most of the sources are not about perfume creation per se. They merely contain information - a chapter here, a table there - which might come handy. AFAIK There's nothing like a college-style textbook on perfume composition. Alas, the industry is extremely conservative and doesn't look kindly on bright-eyed newcomers. Well, we just have to figure it out ourselves. However, many books might also be interesting for those interested in other facets of fragrance: history, chemistry, biology, business etc.   
  
[Jennifer Peace Rhind - Listening to Scent: An Olfactory Journey With Aromatic Plants and Their Extracts](http://www.amazon.com/Listening-Scent-Olfactory-Aromatic-Extracts/dp/1848191251/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412927623&sr=8-1) Nice intro to sharpening your smell sense and memory. Very accessible and quite fun.   
  
[Jean Carles - Method of Creation & Perfumery](http://www.perfumerbook.com/A%20Method%20of%20Creation%20&%20Perfumery.pdf) One of the very few publicly available texts on how to create a perfume in a systematic manner. A very good starter, although definitely neither complete nor up-to-date (it has been written in the 70s and much has happened since then).   
  
The same article can be found, of all places, inside a coffee-table book: [Willian Irving Kauffman - Perfume: Photographs and text (A Dutton visual book)](http://www.amazon.com/Perfume-Photographs-text-Dutton-visual/dp/0525495061/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412859917&sr=8-1-spell) Besides the mentioned article by Jean Carles there are essays on history of perfumery, culture and such. And a lot of pretty pictures.   
  
A more recent version of study charts from Carles (still very incomplete) can be found in an article in an industry magazine _Perfumer & Flavorist_: [Michelle Kydd - Exposing the Perfumer](https://www.scribd.com/doc/166167869/Exposing-the-Perfumer-Michelle-Krell-Kydd-May-2007) As far as I can tell, this is an officially sanctioned download, not a pirated copy.   
  
[Mandy Aftel - Essence and Alchemy: A Book of Perfume](http://www.amazon.com/Essence-Alchemy-Perfume-Mandy-Aftel-ebook/dp/B004VMWJDE/ref=la_B001HOF5W6_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412860220&sr=1-1) I don't like this book, but it is popular, so I include it here. If you can sit through her new age explanations, this book has a fairly gentle intro into perfume making along with descriptions of common natural ingredients. It's basically a reader's digest version of Arctander plus Jean Carles minus anything synthetic.   
  
[Tony Curtis - Introduction of perfume: technology and marketing](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Perfumery-Technology-Tony-Curtis/dp/013491614X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412859713&sr=1-4) It is really an MBA textbook with some perfumey aspects. Mostly it talks about panel tests, focus groups and supply chain optimization. However it does offer a couple of surprisingly good chapters on ingredients and composition (including lab techniques). Note: The author uses strange 3-letter codes for smells which I haven't seen anywhere else.   
  
W.Poucher - Perfumes Cosmetics and Soaps. [Volume 1: Raw materials](http://www.amazon.com/Pouchers-Perfumes-Cosmetics-Soaps-Materials/dp/9401053618/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412861073&sr=1-2) [Volume 2: Perfumes](http://www.amazon.com/Perfumes-Cosmetics-Soaps-Manufacture-Application/dp/9400956967/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412861073&sr=1-3) [Volume 3: Modern Cosmetics](http://www.amazon.com/Perfumes-Cosmetics-Soaps-Vol-Modern/dp/0412106604/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412861073&sr=1-7) Make sure you get the old (<10) edition. As far as I can tell the 10th edition is completely different and it's mostly about cosmetics and business. The older editions . have a feel of an 19th century treatise (well, it was published in 1923) but they are very thorough and give a lot of recipes, probably the more than any other book in the list.   
  
[Muller, Lamparsky - Perfumes, Art, Science and Technology](http://www.amazon.com/Perfumes-Science-Technology-P-M-Muller/dp/940105701X) The book lists Jean Claude Ellena and Edmond Roudnitska among contributors. Havent read it yet, but the preview looks promising.   
  
[Stephan Jellinek - The Psychologial Basis of Perfumery](http://www.amazon.com/Psychological-Basis-Perfumery-Stephan-Jellinek/dp/0751403687/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412859365&sr=1-1) Have it but havent read it yet. Seems like a it's largely about connections between smell and sex. The author is a son and a pupil of a famous perfumer Paul Jellinek. Contains a description of a popular odor classification, Odor Effect chart.   
  
[David J Rowe - Chemistry and Technology of Flavors and Fragrances](http://www.amazon.com/Chemistry-Technology-Flavors-Fragrances-David/dp/084932372X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412859490&sr=1-1), ([Online version](http://bib.convdocs.org/docs/39/38471/conv_1/file1.pdf)) A collection of industry articles. It's mostly about chemistry and industrial processes. Contains a chapter by Luca Turin on his vibration theory of smell.   
  
[Charles Sell - The Chemistry of Fragrances From Perfumer to Consumer](http://www.amazon.com/Chemistry-Fragrances-RSC-Paperbacks/dp/0854048243/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412859411&sr=1-1) As the title implies has a lot of info about chemistry, but also about biology, perception and so on.   
  
[Robert Calkin, Stephan Jellinek - Perfumery: Practice and Principles](http://www.amazon.com/Perfumery-Practice-Principles-Robert-Calkin/dp/0471589349/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412824511&sr=1-4) Although considered a classic, the emphasis is again on industrial-scale processes. Not that informative for an amateur, IMHO   
  
[Shelley Waddington - Perfuming with natural isolates](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1105366294/ref=rdr_ext_tmb) On my reading list. The preview looks promising.   
  
[Miguel A. Teixeira, Oscar Rodríguez, Paula Gomes, Vera Mata, Alírio E. Rodrigues - Perfume Engineering Design, Performance & Classification](http://www.amazon.com/Perfume-Engineering-Design-Performance-Classification/dp/0080993990/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412861828&sr=1-1) An attempt to approach the process of perfume composition by using physical and chemical models. Don't know if it actually works, maybe I should try to code it and see what happens.   
  
[Kevin Goodner and Russell Rouseff - Practical Analysis of Flavor and Fragrance Materials](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Analysis-Flavor-Fragrance-Materials/dp/1405139161/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412928912&sr=8-1&keywords=practical+Analysis+of+Flavor+and+Fragrance+Materials) This is about reverse-engineering smelly stuffs. Gives you an idea of what's possible if you have a lot of fancy equipment.   
  
[Greg Brechbill - Perfumery Book](http://www.perfumerbook.com/The%20Perfumer.htm) More like assorted notes and rants of a disaffected insider, some of which are pretty hard to decipher for an outsider. There is some good info in there, you just have to dig for it.   
  
### Reference books   
  
[Horst Surburg, Johannes Panten - Common Fragrance and Flavor Materials: Preparation, Properties and Uses](http://www.amazon.com/Common-Fragrance-Flavor-Materials-Preparation/dp/352731315X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412859208&sr=1-1) Just a big list of physical and chemical properties.

Online references   
  
[The Big Secret](https://sites.google.com/site/perfumerecipes/) - a website with a collection forumulas for various accords and full-blows perfumes, along with assorted tips. I personally suspect it primary exists to sell stuff on [http://www.creatingperfume.com/](http://www.creatingperfume.com/) but they are not too pushy.   
  
[The Good Scents Company](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/) A big database of perfume ingredients. Looks like it was made in 90s from leftover punchcards, but hey. Also i think you can buy some of the chemicals right there, if you can figure out the navigation.
